  A **trivial checker** that always declines any input.
  
  This checker simply runs `exit 2` and is useful for:

  - Testing framework handling of declined tests
  - Measuring parsing and setup overhead
  - Establishing baseline timing for non-checking operations
  
  Exit code 2 indicates the checker declined to process the input,
  different from rejection (exit 1) which indicates an invalid proof.
run: "exit 2"
