  The official Lean 4 kernel in **parse-only mode**.
  
  This checker only validates that the exported data can be parsed correctly
  without performing full kernel checking. It's useful for:
  
  - Testing export format compatibility
  - Measuring parsing performance separately from verification
  - Debugging export data corruption issues
  
  Uses the same official kernel as the main checker but with `--parse-only` flag.
