version: "1.0"
description: |
  A **trivial checker** that always rejects any input.
  
  This checker simply runs `exit 1` and is useful for:
  
  - Testing framework handling of rejected proofs
  - Validating error reporting and status tracking
  - Establishing baseline performance for failed checks
  
  Exit code 1 indicates the checker found the proof invalid,
  simulating what would happen with malformed or incorrect proofs.
run: "exit 1"
