  The `Init.Prelude` module export from Lean 4 core.
  
  This test contains the absolute minimal set of definitions needed to
  bootstrap Lean 4, including:
  
  - Core types (Bool, Nat, Prop, Type)
  - Basic logical operations
  - Primitive tactics (rfl, apply, etc.)
  - Essential syntax declarations
  
  This is the smallest possible meaningful test case, perfect for testing
  checker correctness on fundamental constructs.
