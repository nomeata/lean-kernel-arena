  The `Init` module export from Lean 4 core.
  
  This test contains the fundamental building blocks of Lean 4, including:
  
  - Basic data types (Nat, List, Array, String, etc.)
  - Core tactics and syntax
  - Foundational mathematical structures
  - Essential metaprogramming infrastructure
  
  This is one of the smallest meaningful test cases, making it ideal for 
  initial checker validation and debugging.
