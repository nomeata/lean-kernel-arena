  The complete `Std` library export from Lean 4.
  
  This test contains the standard library extensions beyond core Lean 4,
  including:
  
  - Enhanced data structures (HashMap, RBTree, etc.)
  - Additional mathematical operations
  - Extended list and array operations
  - Utility functions and theorems
  
  This represents a medium-sized test case, larger than core modules
  but smaller than Mathlib, making it useful for performance testing.
